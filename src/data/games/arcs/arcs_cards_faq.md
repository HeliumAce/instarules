**A:** It returns during scoring even if the ambition did not score any points.

**A:** Yes! Refill is the last step of secure, after you've taken the card.

**A:** Yes! In this case, just draw 1 card.

**A:** Either order.

**A:** Your starports in gates can still build ships and enable Catapult moves, but you can no longer take Captives with them.

**Q:** If this card has changed hands, can multiple players have a starport in the same gate?
**A:** No, it is a maximum of one total.

## Gate Stations

**Q:** What happens if the cluster has no cities?
**A:** If a Gate Station is in a cluster with no other city, it has no type. Destroying it provokes no Outrage. Taxing it yields no resource, but it can still be taxed.

**Q:** What happens if this is transferred with Knowledge Set Free or scrapped from the Caretaker Act III Objective?
**A:** If transferred, your cities in gates still operate in the same way. If scrapped, your cities in gates no longer have a type, so they no longer produce resources when taxed and no longer Provoke Outrage when destroyed.

**A:** Not in Act I. If the Caretaker continues to Act II, Knowledge Set Free allows for Golem trading.

**Q:** When exactly does someone keep a Golem after using it?
**A:** If the player with the Golem Hearth uses a Golem and nobody else has slots. As long as the Golem Hearth is in the game, its holder will always have slots for Golems.

**Q:** Can I override the Imperial Truce Law with the Warrior Golem?
**A:** Nope!

**Q:** Are Golems resources?
**A:** Nope! The text 'can be spent for actions like resources' just means that you spend them in your Prelude to take their listed actions like you do with resources. You can't spend them to take New Actions or, for example, or as inputs for Loyal cards like Loyal Engineers.

## Govern with Authority

**Q:** For the Imperial Action on the War Policy, am I exempt from giving a resource if the Trust has no Weapons?
**A:** No. You have to try to give the maximum amount prompted. So if it has a Weapon but no other resource, give a Weapon. If it has no Weapon but it does have another resource, give the resource.

## Green Vault

**A:** They are returned to the general supply.

## Guild Negotiations

**Q:** In the Call to Order, if I want to force the Advocate to give me a Guild card, how many Favors do I need to return to them?

## Sprinter Drives

**Q:** Can Sprinter Drives activate more uses of Sprinter Drives?
**A:** No, it is not recursive. The more verbose but correct text is: When you move fresh Loyal ships but not with Sprinter Drives, you may move any of them one more time.

**Q:** Can the bonus move be a Catapult move?
**A:** You can Catapult move with the bonus move.

**Q:** If I catapult move and drop off ships in gates along my path, can each ship move again?
**A:** Each fresh Loyal ship that moved can move one more time, independently and to a different destination.

## Survival Overrides

**Q:** Can I use this to simply destroy one of my own ships, even if it does not destroy a non-Loyal one?
**A:** Sure, if you want. Bash it into a planet or asteroid.

## Sycophants

**Q:** If a player provokes Psionic Outrage once and then Weapon Outrage twice on the same turn, how many ships would Sycophant place?
**A:** 2 ships total. The 2 ships is once per turn, not once per turn per Outrage.

**Q:** If this triggers during battle, do the ships I place in the battle system count as attacking ships?
**A:** No.

## Terror Strike

**Q:** If I secure the card, does this count as harming others? Do I take Trophies? What happens exactly?
**A:** Securing this card triggers the Crisis itself, which means you are not harming anyone, you take no Trophies, you do not cause Outrage, and so on. You have plausible deniability.

## The Arbiter

**Q:** Do resource slots limit the number of Captives or Trophies I can give?
**A:** No, the limit of resource slots refers only to giving resources.

**Q:** How does this interact with cards like Well of Empathy that give unlimited resource slots?
**A:** Feel free! Cards that hold resources are considered to have unlimited resource slots for that resource.

## The Dead Live

**Q:** If Blight Hunger is in play, where do destroyed pieces go?
**A:** The Dead Live specifies that pieces that would return to supply are instead placed on the card. Blight Hunger places the pieces on its card before they would return to supply, so Blight Hunger takes precedence.

## Tycoon's Ambition

**Q:** If I have no Material or Fuel, can I use Tycoon's Ambition?
**A:** You can use its ability even if you have zero Material and Fuel.

**Q:** How does this interact with Material Cartel or Fuel Cartel?
**A:** Nothing happens to the Material and Fuel on those cards. You can still use Tycoon's Ambition.

**Q:** In the campaign, how does this interact with frozen resources?
**A:** They are not discarded. You can still use Tycoon's Ambition.

## Tyrant's Authority

**Q:** What if I have none of the matching building in my supply?
**A:** You cannot Annex a building if the corresponding Loyal building supply is empty.

## Uncovering Clues

**Q:** Do cities and starports on Flagships count toward this effect?
**A:** No, they must be on the planet in question.

## Unstable Seeker

**Q:** Does this trigger Gate Ports?
**A:** Yes!

## Upstart

**Q:** If you are the Upstart, have Empath's Bond, and Empath is declared, can you tax a loyal city that you do not control?
**A:** The "any" in Empath's Bond should be interpreted as "non-Loyal," and Callow should be rephrased to "You cannot tax cities that you do not control." As a result, Empath's Bond when active only gives the Upstart the ability to use Rival starports to build and Catapult move.

## Vow of Survival

**Q:** If I win the Commonwealth Ambition, how much Power do I gain?
**A:** You gain Power for second place alone.

## Warden's Levy

**Q:** Which hits to the ships on the card take?
**A:** The ships are on the card take hits for self-hit damage (flame icons and intercept)

## Warrior

**Q:** Do I have to move and battle with the same ships with Tactical?
**A:** You can move and battle with different ships.

**Q:** Can the Tactical move be a Catapult move?
**A:** Yes.

**Q:** Can I do the Tactical move if I end up moving to a space with no ships to battle?
**A:** You must perform a legal Battle action after moving (must have a legal target to attack). Otherwise the move must be undone.

## Weapon Cartel

**Q:** How does the supply on this card interact with other cards and abilities?
**A:** The resources count towards Keeper's Solidarity, but they cannot be discarded for Relic Fence or be stolen.

**Q:** Can I discard this even if there is nothing to steal?
**A:** Yes. Any card that says you can discard it to do something else can simply be discarded.

## Witnesses

**Q:** Do you have to control Witnesses to Catapult move them?
**A:** Yes. The control requisite still applies to Catapult Moves.

**Q:** Do you have to flip a Witness token in Prelude to declare Empath?
**A:** Yes. You must do the first part to declare Empath.
