## INTRODUCTION (Page 2)

In Arcs, you lead a spacefaring society through an epic saga, as you try to survive in the harsh and dangerous Reach at the galaxy's edge. A game of Arcs lasts until someone has enough Power-essentially points. In games with 4 players, someone needs to have at least 27 Power. With 3 players, 30 Power. With 2 players, 33 Power. When the game ends, the player with the most Power wins.

You gain Power by completing ambitions, which are objectives that you declare in play. These are scored at the end of the chapter, when everyone runs out of action cards. The game lasts a varying number of chapters, usually three to five.

Your first game of Arcs will take about 45 minutes per player. After you play a few times, a game should take about 30 minutes per player.

If you want to learn Arcs by watching a video, you'll find a link on the back cover of this rulebook!

## WHAT'S IN THE BOX (Page 2)

### MAP (Page 2)

The map of the Reach is where the action happens. You can move your ships around it, battle Rivals for control over its systems, and tax resources from the cities you build on its planets.

### PLAYER PIECES (Page 2)

Each player has the following pieces. The box contains pieces for 4 players.

#### PLAYER BOARD (Page 2)

This board holds resources, your unbuilt cities, and Rival pieces you take as Trophies and Captives.

#### SHIPS (15) (Page 2)

Ships can move around the map and engage in battles.

#### STARPORTS (5) (Page 2)

Starports are built on planets and are used to build ships.

#### AGENTS (10) (Page 2)

Agents are placed on cards in the Court, a card row next to the map. Once you have the most agents on a card in the Court, you can take it.

#### CITIES (5) (Page 2)

Cities are built on planets and can be taxed to gain resource tokens onto your player board.

#### POWER MARKER (2) (Page 2)

This marker tracks your current Power on the bottom map edge. The second marker is used in expansions to track negative Power and very high Power.

## Page 3

### CARDS (Page 3)

#### ACTION (28) (Page 3)

These cards are played to take actions and declare ambitions. With 2 or 3 players, you don't use the "1" and "7" action cards.

#### SETUP (12) (Page 3)

(4 each for 2-4 players)

One of these cards is used in setup to place players' starting pieces and cover parts of the map.

#### LEADER (8) (Page 3)

These cards give special powers and show a player's starting pieces and resources. They are used in Leaders & Lore mode (page 21).

#### GUILD (25) (Page 3)

These cards represent the support of guildmasters and task forces. They are gained from the Court, often give new actions, and can be stolen.

#### VOX (6) (Page 3)

These cards represent incidents in the Reach that you can turn to your own ends. They are gained from the Court and resolve immediately.

#### LORE (14) (Page 3)

These cards represent long-lost technologies and the intangible qualities of leadership, charm, and rank. They are used in Leaders & Lore mode (page 21).

### OTHER PIECES (Page 3)

#### RESOURCE TOKENS (25) (Page 3)

(5 each of Material, Fuel, Weapons, Relics, Psionic)

Resources represent both assets and the people skilled in using them. They add to ambitions and can be spent for special actions.

#### AMBITION MARKERS (3) (Page 3)

These markers show which ambitions are currently declared. They start on their blue side with lower numbers.

#### BATTLE DICE (18) (Page 3)

(6 each of Assault, Skirmish, Raid)

These dice are used to resolve battle.

#### ZERO MARKER (Page 3)

This marker covers the card number of the lead card, making it 0, when an ambition is declared.

#### CHAPTER MARKER (Page 3)

This marker tracks the current chapter of the game on the map.

#### INITIATIVE MARKER (Page 3)

This marker shows which player will take the first turn of a round.

#### PATH MARKERS (4) (Page 3)

(2 each of long and short)

These are added to the map during setup. They cover gates, making them out of play and connecting the gates of neighboring clusters.

#### OUT-OF-PLAY MARKERS (6) (Page 3)

These are added to the map during setup. They cover planets, making them out of play for the game.

#### AID SHEETS (4) (Page 3)

These sheets summarize how to play and what actions you can take.

## Page 4

## SETUP (Page 4)

### 1. SET UP TABLE (Page 4)

1. Place the map and collect the 18 battle dice and 25 resource tokens.
2. Give the initiative marker to a random player.
3. Shuffle the 20 action cards marked "2" through "6" to start the action deck.
4. 4 Players Only: Shuffle the 8 action cards marked "1" and "7" into the action deck. (Otherwise, return them to the box.)
5. Place the 3 ambition markers on their blue, lower-numbered sides in the Available Markers section of the map.
6. Place the chapter marker on the "1" space of the Chapter track on the map.
7. Place the zero marker in the Ambition Declared slot on the map.
8. Shuffle all 6 Vox and 25 Guild cards to make the Court deck. Draw 3 cards (2 players) or 4 cards (3-4 players) from this deck to make a face-up Court row.
9. Shuffle the setup cards that list your number of players. Draw 1 setup card.
10. In the 2 clusters (2-3 players) or 1 cluster (4 players) on the map marked Out of Play on the setup card, place a path marker over its numbered gate and place 3 out-of-play markers over the planets touching that gate.
11. 2 Players Only: Place the 6 resource tokens matching the 6 planets covered by out-of-play markers onto the ambition boxes:
- Material and Fuel go on Tycoon.
- Weapons go on Warlord.
- Relics go on Keeper.
- Psionics go on Empath.

## Page 5

### 2. SET UP PLAYERS (Page 5)

1. Each player chooses a color, collects the matching player board, 5 cities, 5 starports, 15 ships, and 10 agents, and places the cities in the triangle slots along the top of their player board.
2. Each player puts their Power marker on the "O" Power track space on the map.
3. Players simultaneously place their starting pieces onto the map as follows. The player with the initiative marker does this:
- Place 3 ships and 1 city in the system marked 1A on the setup card. Place the leftmost city from your player board.
- Place 3 ships and 1 starport in the system marked 1B.
- Place 2 ships in the system (3-4 players) or 2 systems (2 players) marked 1C.
- Going clockwise from the player with initiative, the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th players set up in the same way in the systems marked 2A-C, 3A-C, and 4A-C on the setup card, respectively.
4. Each player gains the 2 resource tokens matching the planet icons in their A and B systems, putting them in the leftmost and next leftmost circle slots on their player board, respectively.
5. Each player draws 6 action cards into their hand. 2 Players Only: The player without initiative may discard all 6 action cards in their hand and draw 6 new ones.
6. Discard all action cards not in players' hands into a facedown action discard pile on the map.
- Place 3 ships and 1 city in the system marked 1A on the setup card. Place the leftmost city from your player board.
- Place 3 ships and 1 starport in the system marked 1B.
- Place 2 ships in the system (3-4 players) or 2 systems (2 players) marked 1C.

## Page 6

## CORE CONCEPTS (Page 6)

### THE ARC OF PLAY (Page 6)

In a game of Arcs, you play through a number of chapters, usually three to five. Each chapter is made up of several rounds.

Broadly, in a round, each player will take one turn by playing an action card to do various actions, starting with the player who has initiative. After everyone takes a turn, players check who gets initiative for the next round. You'll learn more in Playing a Chapter (page 8)!

Keep playing rounds until everyone runs out of action cards in their hand. At this point, the chapter ends, players gain Power from ambitions they fulfilled, and everyone draws a new hand of cards. You'll learn more in Ending a Chapter (page 18)!

### POWER & AMBITIONS (Page 6)

Players gain Power by fulfilling ambitions. The player with the initiative marker may choose to declare the ambition shown on the action card they play on their turn, marking the matching ambition box on the right map edge.

At the end of the chapter, players gain Power from declared ambitions that they fulfilled best. It doesn't matter whether another player declared an ambition-anyone can fulfill it.

### THE MAP (Page 6)

The map is made of 6 clusters. Each cluster has 4 systems: 3 planets and 1 gate, which lists the cluster number.

A system is adjacent to other systems sharing a thin border. Adjacency is most important when moving (page 13).

Each gate is adjacent to the 3 planets in its cluster and to the gates of its 2 neighboring clusters.

Each planet is adjacent to the gate in its cluster, and it is adjacent to one or both neighboring planets. Planets separated by a thick, irregular border are not adjacent.

The center of the map with the Arcs logo is not in play.

In setup, 1 or 2 clusters are covered with out-of-play markers on its planets and a path marker on its gate. These clusters are out of play in every way. The path marker joins together the gates of the two neighboring clusters, allowing for movement between them in a single move.

Each planet has a planet type, along with 1 or 2 building slots where you can build cities and starports. (Each planet also has an ID symbol of A, B, or C, used in expansions.)

## Page 7

### RESOURCES & CITIES (Page 7)

There are 5 types of resources matching the 5 planet types. Usually, you gain them by taxing cities (page 12) and raiding Rivals in battle (page 16).

Resources can be spent for various actions (page 17), and some of them add to the Tycoon, Keeper, and Empath ambitions (page 18).

You hold resource tokens in the resource slots on your player board. As you build cities, you open resource slots and uncover Power bonuses for winning ambitions.

### AGENTS & THE COURT (Page 7)

Your agents are the bureaucrats and diplomats that administer your cities and influence powerful interests in the Reach.

Through play, you can place agents on cards in the Court, a row of cards along the edge of the map (Influence, page 13). If you have the most agents on a card in the Court, you can take it (Secure, page 13).

### DAMAGE & CONTROL (Page 7)

Pieces start off fresh-ships are fresh when standing upright, and buildings are fresh on their fully colored side.

By battling, fresh pieces can become damaged, shown by flipping or tipping it over. If a damaged piece is damaged again, it is destroyed, removing it from the map.

You control a system and its contents if you have more fresh ships there than each Rival (other player). On a tie, no one controls the system.

Controlling a system lets you tax Rival cities there and capture their agents, restricts how their ships move, and damages pieces they build (pages 12-13).

### TROPHIES & CAPTIVES (Page 7)

If you destroy a Rival's pieces, put them in the Trophies box on your player board. Trophies add to the Warlord ambition.

Actions such as Battle (page 14) let you destroy Rival pieces.

If you capture a Rival's agents, put them in the Captives box on your player board. Captives add to the Tyrant ambition.

Actions such as Tax (page 12) and Secure (page 13) let you capture Rival agents.

## Page 8

## PLAYING A CHAPTER (Page 8)

A game of Arcs lasts up to 5 chapters. In each chapter, you play some number of rounds. In a round, each player takes one turn, starting with the player with the initiative marker.

Broadly, on your turn, you must play 1 action card, which lets you take one or more actions.

At the end of the round, the initiative marker might go to a new player based on which cards were played.

Keep playing rounds until everyone runs out of action cards. At this point, the chapter ends (page 18).

### STEP 1: PLAYER WITH INITIATIVE TAKES TURN (Page 8)

As the player with initiative, you must play one action card face up as the lead card. You may take one action (pages 12-16) for each action pip on the lead card based on its suit:

- Administration pips can tax, repair, or influence.
- Aggression pips can battle, move, or secure.
- Construction pips can build or repair.
- Mobilization pips can move or influence.

Place the card in the "Lead" card slot on the left map edge, so players can reference it during the round.

#### PASSING INITIATIVE (Page 8)

If you have the initiative, but you have no cards in your hand or just choose to skip your turn, you must pass the initiative.

When you pass the initiative, give the initiative marker to the next clockwise player who has any cards in their hand, then immediately end the round. The player who now has initiative will play the lead card of the new round.

If everyone with cards in their hand passes consecutively, discard all action cards and end the chapter (page 18).

Example: Mikah has the initiative, so she plays the lead card. She plays a Construction card, which lets her build or repair. This card has 3 action pips. She spends one to build, one to repair, and chooses not to take a third action.

## Page 9

### DECLARING AN AMBITION (Page 9)

If you have the initiative, you may declare the ambition shown on your lead card before taking any actions:

- The "1" cards have no ambition. (Four players only.)
- The "2" through 6" cards let you declare the matching ambition. (They are listed on page 18.)
- The "7" cards let you declare any ambition. (Four players only.)

Take the highest-number ambition marker from the Available Markers section on the right map edge, and place it in the ambition box of the declared ambition.

Place the zero marker onto the lead card to cover the card number in its top-left corner-its card number is now 0.

You cannot declare an ambition if all ambitions markers are already placed.

You can even declare an ambition that was declared in an earlier round! Just place another ambition marker in its box.

You cannot declare an ambition multiple times using the same card.

Declaring does not change your card's number of action pips.

Example: Before taking her actions, Mikah declares the Warlord ambition on her card. She places the available ambition marker worth the most Power into the Warlord ambition box on the map. Then she covers the card number on her card with the zero marker, setting it to 0. She still gets 3 action pips!

## Page 10

### STEP 2: OTHER PLAYERS TAKE TURNS (Page 10)

After the player with initiative takes their turn, each other player in clockwise order takes a turn. Players with no cards in their hand skip their turn.

On your turn, you must play an action card in one of three ways:

- Surpass: Play an action card face up of the lead card's suit. Its card number must be higher than the lead card. You may take actions up to the number of action pips on your card.
- Copy: Play any action card face down. You may take only one action of the lead card.
- Pivot: Play an action card face up that is not of the lead card's suit. It can have any card number. You may take only one action on your card.

Place the card in the "Surpass, Copy, or Pivot" card slot on the left map edge, so players can reference it during the round.

Surpassing only needs a card higher than the lead card, not all played cards!

Pivoting does not change the lead suit.

Example: After Mikah played her Construction card to lead the round, Dane takes his turn. He plays an Aggression card to Pivot and chooses to move. Lotus takes the next turn by playing a "5" Construction card. It matches the lead suit of Construction and its card number is higher than "0," so they Surpass and build twice.

#### SEIZING THE INITIATIVE (Page 10)

When you play a card, before taking any actions, you can seize the initiative marker from the player who holds it.

There are two ways to do this:

- You may choose to play an extra action card. Place it face down beside the card you played as a reminder. You do not get actions for it.
- You Surpass with a "7" action card. You still get to take its actions. (Only four-player games have "7" cards.)

Take the initiative marker and lay it down to show it is seized. For the rest of this round, players cannot seize the initiative.

The player with initiative cannot seize the initiative.

To Surpass, you must match the lead suit!

If the initiative is seized, you can still Surpass with a "7" card-you just won't seize the initiative.

## Page 11

### STEP 3: CHECK INITIATIVE (Page 11)

After everyone has taken a turn, check whether the initiative marker goes to a new player.

If no one seized the initiative this round, give the initiative to the player who Surpassed with the highest card number.

If no one Surpassed, the initiative stays with its holder.

If someone seized the initiative this round, that player keeps the initiative.

Example: Lotus played the highest Construction card to Surpass this round. Nobody seized the initiative, so Lotus takes the initiative marker.

### STEP 4: DISCARD CARDS & CHECK FOR NEW ROUND (Page 11)

Discard all played action cards, and any action card used to seize the initiative, into the action discard pile on the map face down.

If any players have any action cards left in their hand, start the next round. Otherwise, end the chapter (page 18).

## Page 12

## STANDARD ACTIONS (Page 12)

### TAX (ADMINISTRATION) (Page 12)

Choose a Loyal city or choose a Rival city you control. Gain 1 resource of the city's planet type from the supply.

If you tax a Rival city, you also capture 1 agent of that Rival from their supply, even if you didn't gain the resource.

Tax Limit: You cannot tax a city more than once per turn.

Captives: Place captured agents in the Captives box on your player board. They add to your Tyrant ambition (page 18).

Loyal pieces are your color. Rival pieces are other players' colors.

Control means you have the most fresh ships in the system.

Resources you gain go in empty resource slots on your player board-see Resources (page 17).

Example: Mikah taxes twice-one Material city of her own and one of Dane's Psionic cities, which she controls. She gains 1 Material and 1 Psionic. Because she taxed Dane's city, she places 1 agent from Dane's supply into her Captives box.

### BUILD (CONSTRUCTION) (Page 12)

You may build a building or a ship:

- Building: Place 1 starport or city in an empty building slot in a system with a Loyal piece. When building a city, use the leftmost city on your player board.
- Ship: Place 1 ship at a Loyal starport.

Each starport can only build one ship per turn.

When you build anything in a system that is controlled by anyone other than you, place the piece damaged.

Damaged ships are tipped over, and damaged buildings are flipped to their darker side.

Example: Dane builds twice. First, he builds a starport at a planet where he has a ship. Then he builds a ship. He can place the ship at any of his starports, so he places it at the starport he just built.

## Page 13

### MOVE (MOBILIZATION & AGGRESSION) (Page 13)

Move any number of Loyal ships from one system to an adjacent system.

If you move from a system with a Loyal starport, you may take Catapult moves-keep moving the ships as much as you want, dropping them off as you want, until they move to a gate controlled by anyone else or they move to any planet.

Out-of-Play Clusters: You cannot move into any systems in out-of-play clusters. The path marker placed on out-of-play gates makes its two neighboring gates adjacent.

A system can be a gate or a planet (page 6).

Systems sharing a single thin border are adjacent.

When you take a Catapult move, check for control before moving in, not after.

You can't Catapult from Rival starports you control.

Example: Lotus moves 2 Loyal ships from a Loyal starport, so they take Catapult moves. They move from the planet into the "4" gate. Normally they would end the move here, but the Catapult lets them move more. They move through the path to the "5" gate, but it is controlled by Mikah, so they stop moving. Lotus will have to take another Move action to keep moving.

### REPAIR (CONSTRUCTION & ADMINISTRATION) (Page 13)

Stand up 1 damaged Loyal ship, or flip over 1 damaged Loyal building. (This can be anywhere on the map!)

### INFLUENCE (MOBILIZATION & ADMINISTRATION) (Page 13)

Place 1 agent on any card in the Court. (The Court is the card row along the map edge.)

### SECURE (AGGRESSION) (Page 13)

Take 1 card from the Court if you have more Loyal agents on it than each Rival. Return all Loyal agents on it to your supply, and capture all Rival agents from the secured card.

Resolve its When Secured action, if any. If it says to discard it, place it in a face-up Court discard pile near the Court deck.

Finally, draw a card from the Court deck and place it face up in the Court in the same spot as the secured card.

Captives: Put agents you capture in the Captives box on your player board. They add to your Tyrant ambition (page 18).

You can't immediately use Prelude actions on the secured card (page 20).

## Page 14

### BATTLE (AGGRESSION) (Page 14)

1. Choose Battle System: Choose 1 system that has any Loyal ships. This is the battle system. These are your attacking ships.
2. Choose Defender: Choose 1 Rival whose pieces are in the battle system. These are their defending pieces.
3. Collect Dice: For each attacking ship, you may collect 1 assault, skirmish, or raid die.
            
Assault dice damage the defender quickly at some cost to you.
Skirmish dice damage the defender slowly but keep you safe.
Raid dice steal stuff from the defender and might damage them but are risky.

Raid Dice Limit: You can only collect raid dice if there are defending buildings or if the defender has no Loyal buildings in any systems on the map.
4. Roll and Resolve Dice: Roll the collected dice. You must resolve all rolled faces in this order:
            
Hit any of your attacking ships once per [attacker hit symbol].
If you rolled any number of [intercept symbol], the defender intercepts you-hit any of your attacking ships once per fresh defending ship. (This can only happen once per battle!)
Hit any of their defending ships once per [ship hit symbol]. Once no defending ships remain, hit any of their defending buildings instead.
Hit any of their defending buildings once per [building hit symbol].
Raid their resources and cards by spending [raid symbol], if you have any attacking ships left (Raiding, page 16).

- Assault dice damage the defender quickly at some cost to you.
- Skirmish dice damage the defender slowly but keep you safe.
- Raid dice steal stuff from the defender and might damage them but are risky.

1. Hit any of your attacking ships once per [attacker hit symbol].
2. If you rolled any number of [intercept symbol], the defender intercepts you-hit any of your attacking ships once per fresh defending ship. (This can only happen once per battle!)
3. Hit any of their defending ships once per [ship hit symbol]. Once no defending ships remain, hit any of their defending buildings instead.
4. Hit any of their defending buildings once per [building hit symbol].
5. Raid their resources and cards by spending [raid symbol], if you have any attacking ships left (Raiding, page 16).

If you hit a fresh piece, it becomes damaged-tip it over if it's a ship or flip it over if it's a building.

If you hit a damaged piece, it is destroyed-remove it.

The attacker takes destroyed defending pieces as Trophies. The defender takes destroyed attacking pieces as Trophies.

Trophies: Place pieces taken as Trophies in the Trophies box on the respective player board. These add to the Warlord ambition (page 18).

A system can be a gate or a planet (page 6).

You may collect fewer dice than the maximum, and you may mix types, but you cannot collect more than 6 dice of a type.

To be clear, the attacker rolls and resolves all the dice. The defender doesn't usually make choices.

## Page 15

Battle Example: Mikah is battling Lotus at a Relic planet. Mikah has 4 fresh ships. Lotus has 1 fresh ship, 2 damaged ships, and 1 damaged city.

Mikah can collect up to 4 dice. She collects 2 assault dice and 2 raid dice.

She rolls the dice and gets [dice symbols].

First, Mikah must take hits. She takes 2 hits-1 from the [attacker hit symbol] and 1 from the [intercept symbol] because Lotus has 1 fresh ship. Mikah chooses to damage two of her ships instead of destroying one.

Next, Mikah deals hits.

With the [ship hit symbol], Mikah chooses to damage Lotus's last fresh ship.

With the [building hit symbol], Mikah must damage Lotus's city, destroying it. It goes in Mikah's Trophies box.

## Page 16

### DESTROYING CITIES (Page 16)

If you destroy a city-even outside battle!-do the following:

1. Provoke Outrage. Discard all resources and Guild cards you have of that city's planet type, placing the discarded cards in a face-up Court discard pile near the Court deck. Place an agent to cover the Outrage icon of that city's planet type on your player board-that resource is now Outraged (see below).
2. Ransack the Court. Secure any card that has any number of the defender's agents. Take all Rival agents on the card as Trophies, not Captives.

Outrage: You cannot spend Outraged resources for their normal Prelude action (page 17).

If you have no Loyal agents, use a placeholder piece until an agent becomes available.

If you already have Outrage of the city's type, perform both steps except placing the agent.

You can still tax Outraged resources and add them to your ambitions.

Example: Because she destroyed a Relic city, Mikah discards all her Relics and Relic Guild cards, then covers her Relic icon with an agent. Then, Mikah takes a card from the Court where Lotus has 1 agent. She takes all 3 Rival agents there into her Trophies box. Finally, she draws a card from the Court deck to refill the Court row.

### RAIDING (Page 16)

If any attacking ships remain after taking hits, you may spend [raid symbol] you rolled to steal resources and Guild cards from the defender, one at a time, by spending the number of [raid symbol] in its raid cost, shown above the resource slot on the player board or in the top-left corner of the Guild card (page 17).

Example: Mikah spends her [raid symbols] to steal 1 Material and 1 Weapon from Lotus's player board. If she had rolled one more [raid symbol], she could have stolen the Relic instead.

## Page 17

## RESOURCES (Page 17)

In your turn's Prelude (page 20), you may spend any number and mix of your resource tokens to optionally use their actions:

- Material: Take a Build or Repair action.
- Fuel: Take a Move action.
- Weapon: This turn, you may spend any action pips from your card play to take Battle actions.
- Relic: Take a Secure action.
- Psionic: Take an action listed on the lead card.

Your Prelude begins when you play an action card and ends when you spend any action pips from the card.

You can't spend resources if you pass the initiative or have no cards.

For Weapons, act like you add "or Battle" to the relevant played card.

Weapons cannot turn actions from other resources into Battle actions.

Resources are held in resource slots. When you take or are given a resource, place it in an empty resource slot of yours. To do this, you may rearrange any resources in your resource slots, but you must discard resources you cannot hold.

If a city returns to your player board and covers a resource slot, rearrange and discard resources as described above.

Each resource slot has a raid cost: the number of [raid symbol] that the attacker in battle must spend to steal the resource.

Some cards say they hold resources. These resources can be spent and add to ambitions, but they can be stolen only as the card describes. If a card holding resources is stolen, the resources on the card stay on it. If it is buried, discarded or scrapped, the resources on it return to the supply.

You can open resource slots by building cities!

## GUILD CARDS (Page 17)

You can gain Guild cards by influencing them in the Court and then securing them (page 13).

Guild cards have 3 parts: their suit, rules, and raid cost.

Suit: This suit icon matches 1 of the 5 resources. It adds to ambitions just like resources-Material and Fuel cards add to the Tycoon ambition, Relic cards add to the Keeper ambition, and Psionic cards add to the Empath ambition. Weapon cards do not add to any ambitions.

Rules: Guild cards give new actions and modifiers (page 20).

Raid Cost: This shows how many [raid symbol] an attacker must spend in battle in order to steal the card.

## Page 18

## ENDING A CHAPTER (Page 18)

The chapter ends when everyone runs out of action cards or when everyone with cards passes the initiative.

When the chapter ends, resolve the following steps.

### STEP 1: SCORE AMBITIONS (Page 18)

Score each ambition that has any number of ambition markers in its ambition box on the map:

- Tycoon. Have the most total Fuel and Material icons from resources and Guild cards.
- Tyrant. Have the most Captives on your player board (gained from taxing and securing).
- Warlord. Have the most Trophies on your player board (gained in battle).
- Keeper. Have the most Relic icons from resources and Guild cards.
- Empath. Have the most Psionic icons from resources and Guild cards.

The player who gets first place for the ambition gains the higher Power shown on all its ambition markers.

The player who gets second place for it gains the lower Power shown on all its ambition markers.

Show the Power you gained by advancing your Power marker on the Power track on the bottom edge of the map.

Ties: On a tie for first place, all tied players get second place. On a tie for second place, the tied players do not place and gain no Power.

Qualifying: You cannot gain Power from an ambition if you have none of the thing it is counting. (For example, if Warlord is declared and nobody has Trophies, nobody gains Power.)

Bonus City Power: Each time you get first place in an ambition (not tied), gain 2 extra Power if the "+2 to won ambitions" city slot on your player board is uncovered, or gain 5 extra if both the "+2 to won ambitions" and "+3 to won ambitions" city slots on your player board are uncovered.

You can only gain bonus Power once per ambition, regardless of how many ambition markers it has.

Example: Tycoon is worth 7 Power. Mikah has 1 Fuel and 1 Material Guild card, and Dane has 2 Material. They tie and each gain 3 Power. Mikah could have gained 2 more Power from her +2 to Won Ambitions slot, but does not because she tied for first.

## Page 19

#### TWO-PLAYER SCORING (Page 19)

During setup with 2 players, 6 resources matching the planets with out-of-play markers are placed on the ambition boxes.

For scoring, count these resources as if a third player had them. Weapons on the Warlord box count as Trophies.

Otherwise, these resources are out of play.

### STEP 2: CLEAN UP & FLIP AMBITION (Page 19)

If Warlord was scored, return all Trophies. If Tyrant was scored, return all Captives.

Return all ambition markers to the Available Markers spaces on the map.

Flip over the ambition marker with the lowest Power that hasn't been flipped yet to its side with more Power.

Starports and ships return to their players' supplies.

Cities return to the rightmost empty city slot on their original player boards.

### STEP 3: END GAME OR ADVANCE CHAPTER (Page 19)

The game ends if any player has at least 27 Power (4 players), 30 Power (3 players), or 33 Power (2 players), or if the chapter marker is currently on Chapter 5.

If the game ends, the player with the most Power is the winner. On a tie, the tied player earliest in turn order is the winner.

If the game does not end, advance the chapter marker to the next space.

### STEP 4: DRAW CARDS (Page 19)

Shuffle all of the action cards. Each player draws a hand of 6 action cards.

Discard all action cards not in players' hands into the action discard pile on the map face down.

The player with initiative starts the next chapter!

#### TWO-PLAYER MULLIGANS (Page 19)

In games with 2 players, after drawing, the player without initiative may discard their hand of 6 action cards to draw a new hand of 6 action cards. They must accept this new hand.

## Page 20

## OTHER ACTIONS (Page 20)

### PRELUDE ACTIONS (Page 20)

Many cards and all resources (page 17) give Prelude actions. On cards, these actions begin with "Prelude:"

Your Prelude begins once you play an action card and ends once you spend an action pip from your played card. You can take any number of Prelude actions, with two limits:

- Resources spent in Prelude return to the supply at the end of your Prelude, so you cannot regain them until then.
- You cannot use Prelude actions on cards that you secured from the Court in the same Prelude.

Some Prelude actions on cards make you discard the card. Place it in a face-up Court discard pile near the Court deck.

Before Prelude actions, you must choose whether or not to declare an ambition or seize the initiative.

### NEW ACTIONS (Page 20)

Cards can give you a new action followed by the name of a standard action in parentheses, such as Assassinate (Battle).

When you would take the standard action by spending an action pip or a non-Outraged resource, you may instead take the new action.

For example, if you spend an action pip to take the Battle action, you can Assassinate instead. You can even do this if you spent a Weapon in your Prelude to allow this.

### MODIFIERS (Page 20)

Cards can give you modifiers to standard actions, which are shown in bold, such as "In battle, collect 1 extra die."

Modifiers do not modify new actions, but they do modify standard actions that are within new actions.

Modifiers can also affect critical play steps, such as setup (pages 4-5), scoring (Step 1, page 18), declare an ambition (page 9), and seize the initiative (page 10).

For example, the Living Structures lore card says "Nurture (Build): Tax a Loyal city." In this case, build modifiers do not modify Nurture, but tax modifiers do modify the Tax action it contains.

## Page 21

## LEADERS & LORE (Page 21)

After playing a game or two, you're ready to play with Leaders and Lore! This mode gives players wild, unique abilities, but they can be hard to handle if you're starting out.

Really, don't play your first game with Leaders and Lore.

- Your leader card gives you unique powers, starting pieces, and starting resources.
- Lore cards give persistent powers. They don't have a guild icon or raid cost, so they do not add to ambitions and cannot be stolen.

### SETUP (Page 21)

Replace Steps N-O of setup (page 5) with the following:

Lay out lore cards and leader cards in face-up rows, each with cards equal to the players plus one.

In reverse turn order-start with the player to the right of the player with initiative, and go counterclockwise-each player may take 1 leader or lore card.

Continue this until each player has 1 leader card and 1 lore card. You cannot take a leader card if you already have one, and you cannot take a lore card if you already have one.

Each player places their starting pieces onto the map in the systems marked on the setup card as shown in the A, B, and C boxes shown on their leader card. Pips under a ship icon show how many ships to place.

Each player gains the 2 resource tokens shown on their leader card, placing them in their 2 leftmost resource slots in the order shown.

Finally, if any leaders have extra setup steps, players perform them in turn order.

Example: The Mystic starts with a Psionic and a Relic. They have initiative, so they place 3 ships and a city in 1A, 3 ships and a starport in 1B, and 2 ships in 1C.

You can set up with as many lore cards as you want, but you run the risk of overwhelming everyone. Be careful!

If you want to increase chaos and uniqueness even more, you can let players choose a second lore card. Just add 1 extra lore card per player to the starting row, and keep choosing cards until each player has 1 leader card and 2 lore cards.

## Page 22

## FINE PRINT (Page 22)

This section covers some technical parts of play.

### TIEBREAKERS & CHOICE ORDER (Page 22)

If you have a tie and its tiebreaker is not specified, break the tie in turn order. Likewise, if players must make a decision in an unclear order, resolve it in turn order. (Start with the player with initiative and go clockwise.)

If multiple things happen at the same time but must be resolved in order, the player taking their turn chooses their order. If no one is taking a turn, the player with initiative chooses.

### ELIMINATION & CONCESSION (Page 22)

Rarely, a player will have no starports or ships on the map. If this happens, they place 3 fresh ships in any gate at the end of their turn.

Sometimes, usually in games with 2 players, it may become clear that a player has won. Feel free to concede!

### PIECES & PIECE LIMITS (Page 22)

Pieces are limited by the contents of the box with one exception: if you need an agent to place on an Outrage slot but none are in your supply, use a placeholder piece until an agent enters your supply, then place the agent.

If a rule makes you place pieces, this refers to fresh Loyal pieces by default.

Pieces that you place and return come from and go to their original supply by default except for cities: cities come from and go to the rightmost empty city slot on their original player board. (Remember, pieces often go to Trophies and Captives instead of back to supplies.)

If you must place or return more pieces than possible, do the maximum possible.

If you replace a piece, return it and place another piece in its place. If the old piece was damaged, the new piece is placed damaged. (Replacing a piece does not destroy it.)

### RULES HIERARCHY (Page 22)

This rulebook supersedes the aid sheets and player boards.

Cards supersede this rulebook, but any rule that uses the term cannot is absolute-it cannot be superseded unless explicitly named using the term ignore. (For example, "You ignore Outrage when spending Material for its Prelude action.")

Sidebars as well as text written in italics and parentheses (like this) are clarifications and reminders, which are superseded by the core rules they reference.

### NEGOTIATIONS (Page 22)

Players may make deals and promises, but they are not binding. Players cannot give each other pieces unless a rule allows it.

### PRIVATE INFORMATION (Page 22)

Players cannot show the action cards in their hand to anyone else.

### TURN ETIQUETTE (Page 22)

Though declaring an ambition and seizing the initiative happen before any other actions, we usually let people do them during their turn as long as new info hasn't been revealed-such as rolling dice or drawing a card-and any relevant modifiers are followed. Don't get bogged down in technicalities unless it changes the game. Arcs thrives when the game flows!

### SPLIT DISCARD PILES (Page 22)

Normally, all action cards are discarded face down, even ones played face up. This speeds up play but it favors players with good memory. If you're running a tournament or want a more strategic but slower game, you can split the action discard into two piles-one for cards played face down, and one for cards played face up.

If you're prompted to draw from the action discard pile, draw from the facedown pile. In the rare circumstance that it doesn't have enough cards, shuffle the piles together first.

## Page 2

## INTRODUCTION (Page 2)

The galaxy is in crisis. The Empire is crumbling. The Blight is spreading through the Reach, destroying everything it touches. What is it? What does it want?

Some believe this is the end. Others, just the beginning. In this time of chaos, new movements bloom loud like desert flowers, promising safety, liberation, communion, or simply the honor of glorious death in the struggle. What will you promise? What is your Fate?

We strongly recommend you play at least one game of single-session Arcs before the campaign. All players should be comfy with the base game. Otherwise, expect a long, tedious first game.

## WHAT'S IN THE BOX (Page 2)

### FATE CARDS & PIECES (Page 2)

#### FATE (24) (Page 2)

(8 each of A, B, and C)

These tarot-size cards show your Fate, which can change over time.

STOP!

Punch out the 24 Fate Set dividers and put them in the deep box wells.

Place the small cards for the 24 Fate Sets behind the dividers of same number. Keep their pieces in bags by their cards or in a different deep well. Keep the large Fate cards in the small raised well.

The cards are marked "F" with the Fate Set's number in the bottom-left corner.

The pieces are on a punchboard sheet in the shaded area marked with the divider shape and the Fate Set's number.

#### FATE SETS (Page 2)

Each Fate has a set of many cards and pieces you will use in play, organized as described below.

#### FATE SET DIVIDERS (Page 2)

Each Fate Set is stored behind the divider of matching number as described below.

1 Fate Set Number

STEWARD 1 26 Divider

Piece & Card Counts

F1 SETUP Card for Fate Set 1

Piece for Fate Set 1

### PLAYER PIECES (Page 2)

Each player has the following pieces. The box contains pieces for 4 players.

#### OBJECTIVE MARKER (Page 2)

This shows how close you are to completing your Fate's objective.

#### FLAGSHIP PIECE (Page 2)

Some Fates turn you into a Flagship, adding this piece to the map.

#### FLAGSHIP BOARD (Page 2)

Some Fates turn you into a Flagship, giving you this board.

## Page 3

## Page 4

## ACT I SETUP (Page 4)

If you are starting a campaign, use this section. Otherwise, use Act II & III Setup (page 7).

Campaign setup is very different from single-session setup. Here are the important changes:

- Do not use setup cards. No clusters will be out of play, and players place their starting pieces differently.
- Use the Guild and Vox cards specific to the campaign Court (marked "CC"). Do not use the cards for the base Court (marked "BC").
- Use the same deck of lore cards as the base game (marked "L"), but you will shuffle lore into the Court deck after dealing the Court.

### 1. SET UP TABLE (Page 4)

1. Place the map on the table and collect the 18 battle dice, 25 resource tokens, 24 Blight tokens, 28 Free cities, and 14 Free starports.
2. Give the initiative marker to a random player.
3. Shuffle the 20 action cards marked "2" through "6" to start the action deck.
4. 4 Players Only: Shuffle the 8 action cards marked "1" and "7" into the action deck.
5. Shuffle 2 Event action cards (2-3 players) or 3 Event action cards (4 players) into the action deck.
6. Place the 3 ambition markers on their blue, lower-numbered sides in the Available Markers section of the map.
7. Place the Chapter track tile to cover the chapter track on the map, with its "Act I & II" side face up, and place the chapter marker on its "1" space.
8. Place the zero marker in the Ambition Declared slot on the map.

## Page 5

1. Shuffle all 15 campaign Vox and Guild cards (marked "CC") to make the Court deck. Deal 3 cards (2 players) or 4 cards (3-4 players) from it into the Court row.
2. Shuffle 1 lore card per player at random from the lore deck into the Court deck. Use the same lore deck as you use in the base game. You can add any lore cards you want from expansion packs.
3. Place the Imperial Council card (01) on its In Session side as the leftmost Court card.
4. 2 Players Only: Slide the Guild Envoys Depart edict card (02) into the first slot in the rules booklet.
5. Shuffle the 3 Govern the Imperial Reach edict cards (03-05) face down, flip them all over, and slide them all face up into the first available slot in the rules booklet.
6. Roll the number die, then set up the 2 Imperial clusters in the rolled cluster and the next clockwise cluster, place 1 Imperial ship in each system. (8 total.)
7. Roll the event die. Place 1 Free city on each planet of the rolled planet ID symbol outside the Imperial clusters.
8. Place 1 damaged Blight (shaded side) in each system outside the Imperial clusters.
9. 2 Players Only: Place the 6 resource tokens matching the planets in Imperial clusters onto the ambition boxes:
            
Material and Fuel go on Tycoon.
Weapons go on Warlord.
Relics go on Keeper.
Psionics go on Empath.

- Material and Fuel go on Tycoon.
- Weapons go on Warlord.
- Relics go on Keeper.
- Psionics go on Empath.

## Page 6

### 2. SET UP PLAYERS (Page 6)

1. Each player chooses a color, collects the player board, 15 ships, 5 cities, 5 starports, and 10 agents of that color, and places those cities in the 5 triangle slots along the top of their player board.
2. Each player draws 2 "A" Fate cards ("A" on card back) and chooses one secretly. After everyone chooses, reveal them and take the matching Fate Sets (page 2).
3. Each player sets up based on the Setup side of their objective card-the first card in their Fate Set-then flips the card to its Objective side.
4. Each player places their objective marker on the Power track space shown by the large clock on their objective card.
5. Each player puts their Power marker on the "O" Power track space on the map.
6. Each player takes a Regent/Outlaw title card (+06-09) and tucks it partially under their Fate card with its Regent side up. If no one has the First Regent tile from their setup, the player with initiative takes it.
7. In turn order, each player places 3 ships and 1 building in an empty building slot at a planet with an Imperial ship and gains 1 resource token of that planet type. (The planet can have Rival pieces.)
8. Repeat the previous step but in reverse turn order-start with the last player in turn order and go counterclockwise.
9. Place Free cities in all empty building slots on planets with Imperial ships. (With 4 players, you might not place any.)
10. Each player draws 6 action cards into their hand. 2 Players Only: The player without initiative may discard all of the action cards in their hand except Events and draw the same number of new cards from the action deck.
11. Discard all action cards not in players' hands into the action discard pile on the map.

## Page 7

## ACT II & III SETUP (Page 7)

Set up Act II or III so it's the same as the previous Act, including Power, with these changes:

1. In Act II, flip the lowest-Power ambition marker to its higher-Power side. In Act III, flip the two lowest-Power ones to their higher-Power sides. The others start on their lower-Power sides.
2. Shuffle the Court deck and deal 3 cards (2 players) or 4 cards (3-4 players) from it into the Court. Flip the Imperial Council card to In Session.
3. Place 1 damaged Blight on each gate that has no Blight and no ships.
4. Roll the event die. In each cluster, place 1 damaged Blight at the planet with the rolled ID symbol if it has no Blight. If it does have Blight, place 1 damaged Blight at each planet in its cluster with no Blight.
5. 2 Players Only: Roll the number die twice. Place the 6 resource tokens matching the planets in the 2 rolled clusters onto ambition boxes as in Step Q of Table Setup in Act I. (If the resource supply empties, just place as much as you can.)
6. Each player sets up using the Setup side of their objective card, then flips it to its Objective side. Each player may also rearrange their resource tokens. If multiple players must make setup choices, resolve them in turn order. (To speed up setup, feel free to do all this simultaneously!)
7. Each player places their objective marker on the Power track space as shown at the top of their objective card. In Act III, only players with a "C" Fate do this step.
8. Place the Chapter track tile on its side that lists the current Act. Place the chapter marker on its "1" space. Draw and discard action cards exactly as in steps J-K of Player Setup in Act I.

## Page 8

## THE CAMPAIGN (Page 8)

A campaign of Arcs lasts for three games, called Acts. Campaign Acts end differently from single-session games.

- Don't end an Act after 5 chapters. Instead, Acts I and II end after 3 chapters, and Act III ends after 4 chapters.
- Don't end an Act early if a player gains enough Power. Ignore the thresholds on the Power track.

While setting up Act I, you choose an "A" Fate. You might play this Fate for all three Acts or switch to a new one.

- If you switch Fate after Act I, you'll choose a "B" Fate.
- If you switch Fate after Act II, you'll choose a "C" Fate.

At the end of Act III, the winner is the player with the most Power accumulated over all three Acts. Break a Power tie in favor of "A" Fates over "B" Fates, and "B" Fates over "C" Fates. Break a further tie in turn order.

You can also win by completing a final objective (page 9).

### OBJECTIVE (Page 8)

In Acts I and II, your Fate gives you an objective.

During setup, place your objective marker on the starting space on the Power track shown at the top of your objective card. Sometimes, the starting space changes based on the number of players, shown by the symbols.

Your objective card gives you ways to advance your objective marker, moving it down the Power track toward 0 Power. When it reaches O Power, you complete your objective!

Winning Ambitions: Some objectives want you to win an ambition-this means you get first place, so you're not tied.

The chapter track tile covers the track used in the single-session game. Use one side in Acts I and II, and use the other in Act III.

In Acts II and III, you may need to track large amounts of Power. Use the second Power marker included in the base game to mark the "+50" or "+100" space near the Power track to show this.

Example: It's the end of a chapter. Lotus is an Outlaw, and they win 2 ambitions and control 3 systems, so they move their objective marker down a total of 9 times!

### INTERMISSION (Page 8)

After Acts I and II, there is an Intermission. In it, you gain a bonus for completing your objective, you might choose a new Fate, and most damaged pieces are destroyed.

If you failed your objective, you lose Power equal to the space of your objective marker on the Power track.

The Intermission is described on page 28.

## Page 9

### GRAND AMBITIONS (Page 9)

In Act III, "A" or "B" Fates give two grand ambitions, shown by gold crosshairs. These give you more ways to gain Power and do not use the objective marker.

At the end of a chapter, grand ambitions are scored at the same time as declared ambitions.

If you fulfilled one grand ambition, gain the lower amount of Power shown under the current chapter on the Chapter track. If you fulfilled both, gain the higher amount.

Your grand ambitions are always active-you do not need to declare them. Rivals cannot gain Power from them.

Example: It is the end of Chapter 3. Dane fulfills one grand ambition, so he gains 4 Power from it.

### FINAL OBJECTIVE (Page 9)

In Act III, "C" Fates have a final objective.

At the end of a chapter, after scoring ambitions, you win the game if your final objective is complete by having your objective marker at "O" and you have at least 1 Power!

- Winning by completing a final objective supersedes winning by having the most Power.
- If you have a final objective, you can still win at the end of Chapter 4 by simply having the most Power.
- If multiple players would win the game by completing their final objective, the winner is the player among them with the most Power.

There is no penalty for failing your final objective. It's just another way to win!

### RULES BOOKLET (Page 9)

As you play, your Fate will add many cards to the rules booklet.

The booklet is double-sided. You can use one side for Edict cards and the other side for Law and Summit cards.

In rare cases where you run out of space on one side for a specific card type, you can use the other side.

As you add cards to this booklet, make sure to explain them aloud, since these rules affect everyone.

Each slot can snugly fit 1 to 3 unsleeved cards. If you sleeve cards, remove their sleeves first.

## Page 10

## THE EMPIRE (Page 10)

Everyone starts as a Regent of a crumbling galactic Empire, shown by their Regent title card tucked into their Fate card.

One Regent is the First Regent, who governs the Empire (page 20) and holds the Imperial Trust (page 21), resources they collect from Regents as tribute for the distant Emperor.

A Regent can become an Outlaw by calling a Summit (page 16). Outlaws can be attacked by the Empire, but they can battle Regents freely and don't pay into the Imperial Trust.

### CONTROL & COMMAND (Page 10)

The Empire controls all systems that have any number of fresh Imperial ships, ignoring all players' Loyal ships.

The First Regent controls all Empire-controlled systems for the purpose of ambitions, objectives, and events (page 12).

On a Regent's turn, they Command the Imperial Fleet following the Presence Law: In systems with Loyal pieces, they control the system if it is Empire-controlled and can take actions with Imperial ships there-move and repair them, battle with them, build at them, and tax cities they control.

If a rule lets you ignore the Presence Law, you Command the Imperial Fleet in all systems, even those with no Loyal pieces.

Example: An Outlaw has 4 fresh Loyal ships in a system. A Regent has 2 fresh Loyal ships there. Regardless of all these ships, 1 fresh Imperial ship is there, so the Empire controls it. On the Regent's turn, they control the system. On the Outlaw's turn, the system is controlled by the Empire, so they build pieces damaged.

### MOVEMENT (Page 10)

Regents also follow the Movement Law: Regents can only move 1 Imperial ship for each Loyal ship they are moving along with them at the same time to the same system.

- Empire control of gates ends the Catapult moves of Outlaw pieces, but not Regent or Imperial pieces.
- Regent control of gates ends the Catapult moves of Outlaw pieces and Rival Regent pieces alone, but not Imperial pieces or mixed Regent and Imperial pieces.
- Outlaw control of gates ends the Catapult moves of Regent and Imperial ships alike.

Rival means it has another player's color.

Most of the time, you take Catapult moves when you move from a Loyal starport.

## Page 11

Example Catapult Move: A Regent takes a Catapult move, moving 2 Imperial and 3 Loyal ships, dropping off 1 Loyal ship. Next, they move 2 Imperial and 2 Loyal ships, dropping off 1 Imperial ship. They finish their Catapult move by moving 1 Imperial and 2 Loyal ships.

### BATTLE, HARM, & TAXING (Page 11)

Finally, Regents follow the Truce Law: Regents cannot harm Imperial ships except for hits they take as attacking ships in battle, and they cannot harm or tax Rival Regents in systems with Imperial ships.

When a Regent attacks in battle, they may add Imperial ships in the battle system to their attacking ships.

When a Regent defends in battle, they must add Imperial ships in the battle system to their defending ships.

Harm means "battle, hit, damage, or destroy" (page 27). The Truce Law does not limit Crises (page 18) in any way.

To hit a Regent's buildings with [attack symbol], an Outlaw must destroy all defending ships, even Imperials.

### OUTLAW BATTLES (Page 11)

Outlaws may choose either a Regent or the Empire as defender.

If the Empire is defending, the defending pieces are the Imperial ships in the battle system, and the First Regent takes any destroyed pieces of the Outlaw as Trophies. If there is no First Regent, they return to the Outlaw.

Example: If the Outlaw battles the Regent, the Regent adds the Imperial ship, so they have 3 defending ships. If the Outlaw battles the Empire, the Empire has 1 defending ship. If the Regent battles the Outlaw, the Regent may add the Imperial ship to their 2 Loyal ships.

## Page 12

## EVENTS (Page 12)

There are three kinds of events: Summits, Crises, and Edicts.

- During a Summit, players can make deals to exchange pieces and favors in a freeform manner.
- During the Crises, the Blight attacks ships on the map, and some Guild and Vox cards cause chaos.
- During the Edicts, the First Regent governs the Empire. Over time, more Edicts are added.

Events can be triggered by playing an Event card or securing the Imperial Council card from the Court (page 14).

### EVENT CARDS (Page 12)

Event cards are a new kind of action card added during setup. They cannot be scrapped.

On your turn, you may play an Event card. You cannot Lead it, Copy with it, or discard it to seize the initiative.

When you play it, you may take actions exactly like you played the lead card.

However, your Event card gives you no actions if a Rival played another Event card earlier this round or secured the Imperial Council earlier this round (page 14)!

Two-Player Mulligans: When you take a mulligan in a two-player game, you must keep any Event cards in your hand and only draw the number of action cards you discarded.

If you have the initiative and only have Event cards, you must pass the initiative.

If you play an event that gives you no actions, you can still take Prelude actions.

Example: Lotus plays a "2" Construction card as the lead card. Dane plays an Event, so he can take 4 Construction actions. Next, Mikah also plays an Event, but she gets no actions from it.

## Page 13

### RESOLVING THE EVENT (Page 13)

At the end of a round where any Event cards were played, do the following just after checking whether initiative changes:

The player with initiative may call the Summit (page 16). Then, they roll the event and number dice and resolve the event die as follows:

- If [Crisis symbol] is rolled, resolve Crises (page 18).
- If [Edict symbol] is rolled, resolve Edicts (page 20).

If multiple Event cards were played, only resolve one. Roll the event and number dice even if a Summit was not called.

For now, ignore the number die and the A, B, and C planet ID symbols on the event die. They are used in Crises (page 18).

Imperial Council: If the Imperial Council (page 14) is secured during the same round as any Event cards are played, resolve the Council and do not resolve the Event card.

Example: Dane and Mikah played Event cards and did not seize the initiative, so Lotus keeps the initiative. Lotus calls the Summit. After it, they roll the event die and number dice, triggering Crises!

## Page 14

## IMPERIAL COUNCIL (Page 14)

The Imperial Council is a card in the Court with two sides: In Session and Decided. In each Act, it starts In Session.

While the Imperial Council is In Session, players may influence and secure it.

The Imperial Council cannot be buried, scrapped, or discarded.

### SECURING THE COUNCIL (Page 14)

When you secure the Council, flip it to Decided and tuck it under your played card as a reminder to resolve it later.

At the end of that round, return the Imperial Council card to the Court on its Decided side, then resolve the following:

1. You may call a Summit (page 16).
2. If you're a Regent, take the First Regent tile, keeping all resources on the Imperial Trust (page 21).
3. If you're an Outlaw, steal resources from the Imperial Trust on the First Regent tile, up to your number of empty resource slots. The First Regent loses 1 Power for each resource stolen.
4. You must choose to resolve either the Crises (page 18) or the Edicts (page 20).

Cards can be attached (page 27) to the Council, even if it's flipped to Decided, and cards like Court Enforcers do affect it.

This is different from resolving an Event card in a couple ways:

- You choose whether to call the Summit, not the player with initiative.
- You choose to resolve either the Crises or Edicts, rather than following the event die.

Event Cards: If the Imperial Council is secured in the same round as Event cards (page 12) are played, resolve the Council and ignore the Event cards.

Example: You're the First Regent and secure the Council. When the round ends, you call the Summit and become an Outlaw, giving away First Regent. Then, you steal 3 resources from the Imperial Trust, making the new First Regent lose 3 Power. Tough first day on the job!

### IMPERIAL COUNCIL DECIDED (Page 14)

Securing the Imperial Council flips it to its Decided side. While it is Decided, players cannot influence or secure it.

It flips back to In Session at the start of an Act (page 7), and you can flip it to In Session if you call a Summit and Petition the Council (page 16).

## Page 15

## THE FREE STATES (Page 15)

As the Empire crumbles, some people have escaped its grip, declared independence, and formed the Free States.

You may take actions with Free buildings that you control-tax Free cities, build ships at Free starports and Catapult move from them, and repair Free cities and starports.

Harming & Trophies: Just like players' buildings, Free buildings can be harmed-battled, hit, damaged, and destroyed. Take Free buildings you destroy as Trophies.

Battling: If you choose the Free States as defender in battle, all Free buildings in the battle system are defending pieces. They take hits from rolled dice like players' buildings.

Raiding: You may raid the Free States. You may gain exactly 1 resource matching its planet type by spending [raid symbol]. You cannot gain multiple resources from the Free States in the same battle.

Empty Supply: In the rare event that you must place a Free building but the supply is empty, use a proxy piece.

Taxing a Free city does not let you capture agents.

Destroying a Free city still Provokes Outrage.

## Page 16

## SUMMITS (Page 16)

Event cards and the Imperial Council let players call the Summit. It has two parts: Call to Order, then Negotiations.

Broadly, in the Call to Order you can return Favors-Rival agents you have collected on your Fate card-to your Rivals to force them to take Negotiation actions, and you can interact with Imperial politics.

Then, in Negotiations, everyone can take Negotiation actions in a freeform manner, including giving each other Favors that can be returned in later Summits.

### CALL TO ORDER (Page 16)

The player who called the Summit may take any number of Call to Order actions, listed below:

- Return Favors: Return a Rival's Favors to their supply to force them to take Negotiation actions (page 17) you choose, targeting you, in the way you choose. By default, each Negotiation action you force costs 1 Favor.
- Petition the Council: Flip the Imperial Council card to its In Session side.
- Leave the Empire: Flip your Regent title card to Outlaw. If you are the First Regent, give the First Regent tile to the Regent with the most Power. Resources stay in the Imperial Trust. If there are no Regents, return all resources from the Imperial Trust to the supply, lose 1 Power per resource returned, and place the First Regent tile in the supply.
- Revive the Empire: If there are no Regents, flip your Outlaw title card to Regent and take the First Regent tile.

Rival agents on your Fate card are Favors.

Generally, you get Favors through Negotiations (page 17) and the Imperial Demand (page 20).

Example: Lotus calls the Summit to order. They return two of Dane's Favors to him to force him to give them a Relic (Transfer Asset), since it has a raid cost of 2! Then, they Petition the Council to flip it to In Session. They can do this even though they called the Summit by securing the Council.

## Page 17

### NEGOTIATIONS (Page 17)

After the Call to Order, all players may take any number of Negotiation actions listed below in a freeform manner.

Each Negotiation action affects a Rival. To take a Negotiation action, you need the consent of the affected Rival.

- Cede Control: Replace 1 Loyal piece on the map with 1 Rival piece of that type. You can only replace a Loyal building if no Loyal ships are in its system, and you cannot replace your last city, starport, or ship on the map.
- Delegate Authority: Replace 1 Loyal agent on a card in the Court with a Rival's agent.
- Promise Favor: Give 1 Loyal agent from your supply to a Rival, placing it on their Fate card. Rival agents on a Fate card are called Favors.
- Transfer Asset: Give 1 Captive, Trophy, Favor, or resource you have to a Rival. If it is their Loyal piece, return it to their supply. Forcing you to give a resource with Return Favors (page 16) costs Favors equal to its raid cost.
- Invite to Empire: If you're the First Regent, flip an Outlaw's title card to Regent.

If you replace a piece, return it and place another piece in its place. If the old piece was damaged, the new piece is placed damaged.

Transfer Asset does not let you give away cards. However, some Fates might let you...

### MULTIPART NEGOTIATIONS (Page 17)

You may agree with any players to simultaneously take any number of Negotiation actions that can be resolved immediately.

Example: Mikah wants Dane to replace 1 Loyal agent of his with hers on the Construction Union card in the Court (Delegate Authority). Dane wants Mikah to replace 2 Loyal ships of hers on the map with his (Cede Control). They agree and take all these actions at once! All these pieces come from and return to their supplies.

### ENDING NEGOTIATIONS (Page 17)

If no one is negotiating, the player who called the Summit may call for them to start negotiating, wait briefly, and then count down from five seconds. If no one starts negotiating, the Summit ends.

## Page 18

## CRISES (Page 18)

Event cards and the Imperial Council can trigger the Crises. When the Crises are triggered, resolve the Blight Crises, then Fate Crises, and finally Court Crises.

### BLIGHT CRISES (Page 18)

Each system with Blight has a Blight Crisis-each fresh Blight there deals 3 hits, and each damaged Blight there deals 1 hit.

The Blight deals hits to Imperial ships first. If no Imperial ships remain, it deals each remaining hit to the Loyal ships of every player in its system. In both cases, fresh ships take hits before damaged ships.

For Flagships in a Blight Crisis, read Flagships in Events (page 24).

Blight hits buildings only during the Intermission (page 28).

Example: A fresh Blight deals hits! It hits the fresh Imperial ship twice, destroying it. Then it hits 1 Loyal ship of each player there.

### FATE CRISES (Page 18)

Some Fates add cards with Crisis text that are held by players. Resolve all of these cards in turn order.

### COURT CRISES (Page 18)

Roll the event and number dice unless you just rolled them to resolve an Event card.

Resolve the Crisis text on each Vox card in the Court from left to right.

Attached Cards: If a Vox card has another Vox card attached to it (page 27), resolve the attached card first.

Event & Number Dice: Some Crises determine how they resolve using the icon and number on the event and number dice. Here are the key phrases that refer to these dice:

- Rolled Cluster: The cluster rolled on the number die.
- Planets of the Rolled Symbol: Each planet with the planet ID symbol (A/B/C) rolled on the event die.
- Rolled Planet: The planet in the cluster rolled on the number die and the ID (A/B/C) rolled on the event die.
- If A/B/C Was Rolled: Check whether this symbol was rolled on the event die.

When checking for specific symbols, it doesn't matter whether you rolled the Crisis or Edict symbol as well.

Removing Cards: If a Crisis removes a card from the Court, return all agents on it and draw a card from the Court deck to refill the Court.

Many cards bury themselves after their Crisis. Bury means "place on the bottom of the Court deck."

## Page 19

## THE BLIGHT (Page 19)

The Blight is a mysterious entity spreading through the Reach. No one knows what it wants or how to communicate with it.

In Crises (page 18), the Blight hits ships. In the Intermission (page 28), it destroys buildings in systems with no ships.

- Harming & Trophies: Blight can be harmed-battled, hit, damaged, and destroyed. However, it is Tough-it takes 2 hits to damage or destroy. One hit does nothing. Take Blight that you destroy as Trophies.
- Battling: If you choose the Blight as defender in battle, all Blight in the battle system are defending pieces. Blight is hit with [attack symbol] but not [another symbol]. Blight does not intercept.
- Catapult Movement: Players taking a Catapult move must end it if they move into a gate with fresh or damaged Blight, like if a Rival controlled the gate.
- Empty Supply: If you must place Blight but the supply is empty, take it from the player who has the most Blight Trophies.

Fresh Blight: Takes 2 hits to damage or destroy. Deals 3 hits in Blight Crisis.

Blight ends Catapult moves!

Example: In battle, you choose the Blight as defender. You roll two dice and get [symbols]. You don't take any hits, and you damage the Blight, flipping it from fresh to damaged.

## Page 20

## EDICTS (Page 20)

Event cards and the Imperial Council can trigger the Edicts. Resolve all Edicts in order from lowest number to highest.

The game starts with Govern the Imperial Reach (Edict 03) and Guild Envoys Depart (Edict 00) in two-player games.

### GOVERN THE IMPERIAL REACH (Page 20)

The First Regent must either enforce this Policy or change to a new Policy Card.

- If they enforce it, they collect the listed Imperial Demand and then take the listed Imperial Action, as described through the rest of this section.
- If they change it, they choose a new Govern the Imperial Reach edict card to place on top of the other two cards.

### COLLECT IMPERIAL DEMAND (Page 20)

The First Regent must take 1 piece from each Regent as shown by the Demand of the Imperial Policy, as follows:

- Peace: Relics or Psionics
- Escalation: Material, Fuel, or Weapons
- War: Trophies or Captives, but not Regent or Imperial pieces

Resources go on the First Regent tile, adding to the Imperial Trust (page 21). The First Regent must also add 1 resource shown by the Demand to the Trust, if they have it.

Trophies and Captives go in the First Regent's Trophies and Captives boxes, respectively. The First Regent does not need to take a Trophy or Captive from themself.

If a Rival Regent has no pieces shown by the Demand, the First Regent must take 1 agent from the Rival's supply as a Favor. If they have no agents, the First Regent may make them an Outlaw.

Rival agents taken as Favors go on your Fate card. They are used in Summits (page 16).

Example: The Policy is Peace, which demands Relics and Psionic. Lotus, the First Regent, takes the Demand from each Regent-a Relic from Mikah, a Psionic from Baz, and an agent as a Favor from Dane, who has no Relics or Psionic. Lotus adds both resources to the Imperial Trust on their First Regent tile. Lotus has no Relics or Psionics, so they don't add one.

## Page 21

### TAKE IMPERIAL ACTION (Page 21)

After the Imperial Demand, the First Regent must take the Imperial Action, as follows:

- In Peace, Celebrate Regency: Each Regent gains the bonus city Power shown on all uncovered city slots on their player board.
- In Escalation, Requisition Ships: Place 2 fresh Imperial ships in an Empire-controlled system. If no systems are controlled by the Empire, place them at a Loyal starport instead.
- In War, Distribute Arms: Give 1 Weapon to each Regent from the supply. If the supply is empty, give it from the Imperial Trust.

In War, if there aren't enough Weapons to give out, you choose which Regents get them.

Example: Because the First Regent enforced the Imperial Policy, they must take the Imperial Action. One Regent has all 5 cities built, so they gain 5 Power. Nobody else has more than 3 cities built, so they gain no Power.

### GUILD ENVOYS DEPART (Page 21)

This card is only used in two-player games.

Bury all Guild cards in the Court with no agents on them, then refill the Court.

This only buries Guild cards, not Vox cards or other types!

### IMPERIAL TRUST (Page 21)

By enforcing the Imperial Policy, the First Regent adds resources to the Imperial Trust on their First Regent tile.

Resources in the Imperial Trust are frozen (page 27).

You cannot spend, discard, or give away the frozen resources on the Imperial Trust, even if you Provoke Outrage. But they still add to your ambitions!

Stealing: These resources have no raid cost, so they cannot be stolen in battle. However, cards such as Silver-Tongues can steal them, and Outlaws can steal them by securing the Imperial Council (page 14).

Intermission: Resources on the Imperial Trust return to the supply during the Intermission (page 28).

## Page 22

## FLAGSHIPS (Page 22)

Some Fates give you a Flagship board, piece, and aid card. When you get a Flagship, you also replace all of your Loyal buildings on the map with Free buildings of the same type.

Flagship setup is described on the back of the Flagship board. Your Flagship is a fresh Loyal ship that cannot be removed from the map. Playing a Flagship has some new rules:

- You cannot build Loyal cities or starports on the map. Instead, you can build them on your Flagship board as Upgrades and Armor. (See Upgrades & Armor.)
- You can only build up to 1 ship at your Flagship per turn, ignoring the number of starports on your Flagship board.
- In battle, your Flagship collects a variable number of dice, and it does not deal hits for an intercept by default. (See Defending, page 24.)

Some lore lets you build on the map again-see Lore & Flagships (page 25).

You can build ships at Free starports you control (page 15) in addition to the ship you can build at your Flagship.

### UPGRADES & ARMOR (Page 22)

Your Flagship board has 6 Upgrade slots, each with an Armor slot above it, that you can build Loyal buildings in.

- Upgrades give benefits (page 25).
- Armor takes hits before its matched Upgrade.

To build an Upgrade or Armor, your Flagship must be at a planet of the type shown on its slot. You can only build Armor if you have its Upgrade and it is fresh.

When you repair your Flagship, repair an Upgrade or Armor.

Upgrades and Armor do not work like buildings on the map:

- Players cannot tax these cities and cannot use these starports to build ships or Catapult move.
- Destroying these cities does not Provoke Outrage or Ransack the Court.

Upgrades and Armor give their benefit whether they're fresh or damaged.

Example: Your Flagship is at a Material planet, so you can build a city or starport as a Ship Crane Upgrade. You build a starport in its Upgrade slot. A Rival controls the system, so it is placed damaged. After repairing your Ship Crane Upgrade, you can build Armor for the Ship Crane while you're at a Fuel planet.

## Page 23

### FLAGSHIP BATTLES (Page 23)

There are a few key rules when battling with Flagships:

- When attacking with a Flagship, its Armor and Upgrades are hit like ships.
- When defending with a Flagship, its Armor and Upgrades are hit like buildings.
- Armor is always hit before its Upgrade.

Your Flagship collects no dice if you have no fresh starports in your Upgrades and Armor!

#### ATTACKING (Page 23)

When attacking, your Flagship collects dice up to your number of fresh starports on Upgrades and Armor.

While attacking, Upgrades and Armor are hit like ships:

- You must take hits from [symbols] and [symbols] with Upgrades and Armor if no other attacking ships remain.
- You can choose to take hits with Upgrades and Armor instead of other attacking ships.

Example: Your Flagship has 2 fresh starports. You collect 2 assault dice along with the dice you collect for your other attacking ships. When you take a [hit symbol], you choose to hit your Ship Crane even though you have other attacking ships you could hit.

## Page 24

#### DEFENDING (Page 24)

While you have a Flagship, Rivals who battle you have a different Raid Dice Limit: they can only collect raid dice if there are defending buildings or a defending Flagship.

If the attacker rolls a [intercept symbol], your Flagship does not intercept unless it has a Defense Array (page 25).

While defending, Upgrades and Armor are hit like buildings:

- The attacker hits your Upgrades and Armor with [hit symbol].
- If the Flagship is the only remaining defending ship, the attacker hits Upgrades and Armor with [another hit symbol].

It's possible to get Loyal buildings back on the map if you have the right lore (page 25).

Other defending ships still intercept even if your Flagship cannot.

Remember, destroying cities in Upgrade and Armor slots doesn't Provoke Outrage or Ransack the Court (page 22).

Example: The attacker rolls [dice symbols]. You're defending with a fresh ship and a Flagship with no Defense Array, so they take 1 intercept hit. The [hit symbol] destroy the fresh ship. The third [hit symbol] and the [another hit symbol] hit the Hull Armor twice, destroying it.

### FLAGSHIPS IN EVENTS (Page 24)

When taking hits in a Crisis, your Flagship only takes hits if no other fresh Loyal ships remain in the system.

Take each hit to your Flagship with your rightmost Armor. If no Armor remains, take the hit with its rightmost Upgrade.

In Summits, you cannot use Cede Control to replace Loyal buildings on your Flagship board with Rival pieces.

Hit order: First, top row from right to left. Then, bottom row from right to left.

## Page 25

### LORE & FLAGSHIPS (Page 25)

Lore works with Flagships as follows:

- Building Checks: Lore that checks for Loyal buildings in a system-like Force Beams, Gate Ports, and Hidden Harbors-counts Upgrades and Armor as in your Flagship's system unless the lore says "on the map."
- Building on the Map: Lore that builds Loyal buildings outside building slots-like Gate Ports and Cloud Cities-does let you place Loyal buildings on the map again.
- Ship Improvements: Lore that improves your Loyal ships-like Sprinter Drives and Mirror Plating-does improve your Flagship, since it is a fresh Loyal ship.
- Dice Collection: Lore that collects dice for Loyal ships like in battle-like Galactic Rifles-lets your Flagship collect 1 die per fresh starport on your Flagship board.

If you use lore to build Loyal buildings back on the map, Rivals can raid them as normal.

### FLAGSHIP UPGRADE BENEFITS (Page 25)

This section lists the Flagship's Upgrades. The resource types in parentheses are the planet types that your Flagship must be at in order to build the Upgrade and Armor, respectively.

- Ship Crane (Material → Fuel): You may build up to 2 ships per turn in your Flagship's system. (Doesn't let you build 2 ships with 1 action.)
- Defense Array (Weapon → Psionic): When your Flagship is defending in battle, it deals intercept hits equal to the number of fresh starports on its Flagship board.
- Slipstream Drive (Fuel → Relic): Once per turn, in your Prelude, you may Catapult move either your Flagship alone or other ships from your Flagship. (You don't need this to Catapult from Free starports.)
- Control Array (Psionic → Material): While your Flagship is in a gate, you may tax any cities in its cluster like they are Loyal. (Do not capture agents.)
- Tractor Beam (Relic → Weapon): When your Flagship is defending in battle, the attacker cannot collect raid dice.
- Hull (Any Planet → Any Planet): This Upgrade has no unique benefit, but building cities will open resource slots, and building starports will let you collect more dice in battle.

### RESETTLING FLAGSHIPS (Page 25)

The "C" Fates let you Resettle if you have a Flagship:

1. Clear your Flagship board and return it to the box. Replace your Loyal Flagship piece with a Loyal ship. (Clear means return cities/starports on board to supply.)
2. Place 1 city and 1 starport in empty building slots on the map. If there are none, replace Free buildings.
3. If you have fewer than 8 Loyal ships on the map, place ships in systems with Loyal pieces until you have 8 Loyal ships on the map.

## Page 27

## NEW RULES & TERMS (Page 27)

### PROTECTED GUILD CARDS (Page 27)

Some Guild cards in the campaign are protected, shown by an "X" icon in place of their raid cost.

Protected Guild cards cannot be removed from the holder's play area unless the holder Provokes Outrage of its suit. (Still discard on Fuel Outrage!)

### ATTACHING CARDS (Page 27)

If you are prompted to attach a card, place above a card in the Court that does not have an attached card.

When you secure a card, also secure its attached card. If both have When Secured actions, resolve them in either order.

Forced Attach: If you are forced to attach a card but you cannot fulfill all of the requirements to attach it, you still attach it, ignoring the fewest requirements to attach it.

Removal from Court: If a card is removed from the Court in any way and it has an attached card, refill the Court by sliding down the attached card. Place all agents from the removed card onto the previously attached card. If an attached card is removed, nothing happens to the card it was attached to.

### RESOURCES (Page 27)

Frozen: Sometimes resources are frozen. They cannot be spent, given, or discarded-even from Provoke Outrage-except as described by the piece freezing them. However, Rivals can steal and take frozen resources, including for the Imperial Demand (page 20). Frozen resources still add to your ambitions!

Counting: When you are prompted to count how many resources you have, count everything in your play area, including on cards and on tiles such as the First Regent tile.

### HARM (Page 27)

Some rules refer to harm-this means choosing as defender in battle, damaging, destroying, or hitting.

Most often, you Provoke Outrage when you destroy a city.

### TOKENS (Page 27)

Many Fates add new punchboard tokens. By default, tokens added by Fates cannot be harmed. Some tokens do say they can be harmed, ignoring this rule.

By default, tokens added by Fates are not Loyal. However, some do say they are Loyal-you treat them as being your player color, and Rivals treat them as Rival pieces. You can build buildings at Loyal tokens, you can repair damaged Loyal tokens, and they fulfill the need for Loyal pieces found in rules such as the Empire's Presence Law (page 10).

## Page 28

## INTERMISSION (Page 28)

The Intermission happens at the end of Act I and Act II. Resolve all of the following steps in order.

### A. RESOLVE FATE (Page 28)

Each player resolves the Resolution card in their Fate Set for the current Act.

Based on whether you completed or failed your objective, you'll do things like gain or discard cards, add cards to the Court deck, or add cards to the rules booklet.

Each player who failed their objective loses Power equal to the space of their objective marker on the Power track.

While you have less than 1 Power, you can't win with a final objective in Act III (page 9).

Example: Dane failed his objective. His objective marker is on the "5" space, so he lowers his Power from 2 to -3. He puts his Power marker on "3" and his extra Power marker on the "(-)" space by the Power track to show his Power is negative.

### B. CLEAR COURT (Page 28)

1. Return all cards in the Court except the Imperial Council to the Court deck. (Make sure to also return attached cards.)
2. Return all agents from the Court to their players.
3. Scrap the Court discard pile. (Scrap removes the piece forever.)

### C. CLEAR PIECES (Page 28)

1. Return all Trophies and Captives to their players.
2. Return all frozen resources (page 27), including from the Imperial Trust on the First Regent tile, to the supply.
3. 2 Players Only: Return all resources from ambition boxes to the supply.

### D. REPAIR & DESTROY PIECES (Page 28)

1. Repair all damaged Blight.
2. Destroy all damaged ships, buildings, and Flagship Upgrades and Armor.
3. Destroy all buildings in systems that have Blight and no ships.

In the rare case that you have no ships or starports left on the map, place 3 fresh ships in any gate, following the Elimination condition in the base game.

## Page 29

### E. SHIFT INITIATIVE & POWER (Page 29)

1. Give the initiative marker to the player with the most Power.
2. Each player who has more than 1 Power loses half their Power, rounding to lose less Power.

Conceding: In games with 2 players, if your Rival has at least 15 Power more than you after halving Power, we recommend that you concede unless you feel confident.

Example: Lotus has 7 Power and Dane has -3 Power. Lotus halves her Power to 4, and Dane stays at -3.

### F. CHOOSE FATE (Page 29)

Each player who completed their objective draws 1 Fate card. Each player who failed it returns their Fate card to the box and draws 2 Fate cards.

- If you are finishing Act I, draw from the "B" Fates.
- If you are finishing Act II, draw from the "C" Fates.

Each player secretly chooses 1 Fate card from these 2 Fate cards to play in the next Act. Then, everyone reveals their chosen Fate card simultaneously.

If you choose a new Fate card, do the following:

- Return your current Fate card to the box.
- Scrap the rest of your Fate Set that is not in play. Don't scrap anything that is in play, including your Flagship if you have one!
- Return all Favors you have to your Rivals. (Favors are Rival agents on your Fate card.)
- Take the new Fate Set for your Fate from the box.

If you are choosing between your current Fate and a new Fate, hide the card back of your chosen Fate.

### NEXT ACT? (Page 29)

At this point, discuss with everyone whether you want to play the next Act or pack up the game so you can play it later.

If you are playing the next Act, set it up as described in Act II & III Setup (page 7).

If you are packing up, read Packing Up on the next page. Note that you won't be able to play a single-session game of Arcs until you finish the campaign or choose to abandon it!

## Page 30

## PACKING UP (Page 30)

For the next Act, preserve everything on the map, in the general supply, and in everyone's play areas as follows:

- Use a log sheet to record your names, colors, Fates, Power, Outrage, and Flagship Upgrades and Armor. If a Fate has you record more details, use the blank spaces on the back of the log sheet.
- Use the 2 map trays to store the pieces on the map. The trays have sections for each planet (marked with its ID symbol) and each gate (marked "G").
- If a system has too many pieces to fit in the tray, put an overflow marker in its tray section and put pieces from the system in a bag with the matching overflow marker.
- Use the 4 player trays to store the players' play areas. In your tray, use the large well to hold cards in play stacked on top of the cards remaining in your Fate Set. Use the small well to hold everything else in your play area except your player board and Flagship board. You don't need to track the order of your resources.
- Keep all of the cards in the rules booklet.

### ORGANIZING THE BOX (Page 30)

The expansion box can fit everything from the base game. It has 6 wells-a small well, 4 lower wells, and a deep well.

The small well fits the large Fate cards, the log sheet pad, and leader cards from the base game.

The 4 lower wells store small cards and unused Fate Sets.

- Use dividers in these wells to store unused Fate Sets, the action deck, base and campaign Court decks, lore deck, small cards from the base game, and scrapped cards.
- You may store the bags of pieces for Fate Sets with their cards behind their divider or in a separate well. If you sleeve cards, store the piece bags in a separate well.
- Stack the game board, player boards, and Flagship boards on top of the lower wells.

The deep well stores the 8 removable trays: 4 player trays, 2 map trays, the base game tray, and the campaign game tray.

- The base game and campaign trays can be packed in many ways, but we recommend you pack them as shown to the right and use them during play to keep the table tidy.
- Stack the base and campaign game trays in the deep well, and stack the 4 player trays over them. Place one rulebook over them. Stack the 2 map trays over the rulebook. Place any other rulebooks and aids at the top.

Log Sheet Example: MIKAH BLUE STEWARD 13 Fate and Power in Act / BLUE MP CSA Outrage Flagship Pieces. Use abbreviations-M for Material, C for city, S for starport, etc.

Extra imperial ships can share the chamber with the free starports.

## Faithful Cards (ID: ARCS-F813)

Faithful cards are a new suit of action cards. When you **secure** one from the Court, draw it into your hand.
 
When you play one, place the card on either its ***Zeal*** or ***Wisdom*** side.
 
Zeal lets you move, influence, battle, or tax
 
Wisdom lets you build, repair, or secure
 
**They have a couple differences from normal action cards:**
 
To **Surpass** a Faithful card, you must play a Faithful card on the same side. *(So if a player leads Zeal, you only Surpass if you play Zeal. You can still Pivot to Wisdom.)*
 
You do not seize the initiative when you **Surpass** with a "7" Faithful action card.
