A game of Arcs lasts until someone has enough Power—essentially points. In games with 4 players, someone needs to have at least 27 Power. With 3 players, 30 Power. With 2 players, 33 Power. When the game ends, the player with the most Power wins. You gain Power by completing ambitions, which are objectives that you declare in play. These are scored at the end of the chapter, when everyone runs out of action cards. The game lasts a varying number of chapters, usually three to five.",

Set Up Players: Each player chooses a color, collects the matching player board, 5 cities, 5 starports, 15 ships, and 10 agents, and places the cities in the triangle slots along the top of their player board. Each player puts their Power marker on the '0' Power track space on the map. Players simultaneously place their starting pieces onto the map according to the setup card. 3. Starting Conditions and Draw Cards: Each player gains the 2 resource tokens matching the planet icons in their A and B systems, putting them in the leftmost and next leftmost circle slots on their player board, respectively. Each player draws 6 action cards into their hand. 2 Players Only: The player without initiative may discard all 6 action cards in their hand and draw 6 new ones.

After everyone takes a turn, players check who gets initiative for the next round. Keep playing rounds until everyone runs out of action cards.

The player with the initiative marker may choose to declare the ambition shown on the action card they play on their turn, marking the matching ambition box on the right map edge.

Continue this until each player has 1 leader card and 1 lore card. You cannot take a leader card if you already have one, and you cannot take a lore card if you already have one. Each player places their starting pieces onto the map in the systems marked on the setup card as shown in the A, B, and C boxes shown on their leader card. Pips under a ship icon show how many ships to place. Each player gains the 2 resource tokens shown on their leader card, placing them in their 2 leftmost resource slots in the order shown. If you want to increase chaos and uniqueness even more, you can let players choose a second lore card. Just add 1 extra lore card per player to the starting row, and keep choosing cards until each player has 1 leader card and 2 lore cards.",
