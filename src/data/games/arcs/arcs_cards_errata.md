# Arcs Card Errata

This document contains official errata and clarifications for Arcs cards.

## Upstart

**Errata:**
- To clarify how it interacts with other card abilities, the *Callow* ability should read: "You cannot **tax** cities that you do not control."

## Navy Reprisal

**Errata:**
- This card is misprinted as an event card in the first printing of Arcs: The Blighted Reach Expansion. We will be issuing a professionally printed correction. As of June 2024, our plan right now is to wait a month or two in case any other errors of this nature crop up. At that point, we'll be offering an errata pack on our store with free shipping (it may have a nominal cost of 1 dollar or so). We'll also include a corrected copy in the next Arcs product. You can find a print-quality version of the file [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/yfvmyj5dx74e1ebzn9pav/Navy-Reprisal.pdf?rlkey=aasfbpazvczni9zfr5nv6cnbv&dl=0).

## Empath's Bond

**Errata:**
- The term 'blockaded' present in the first-printing clarification is an old term for 'controlled by anything other than you.' In the base game, all that matters is Rival control. In the campaign, this can include control by the Empire, etc.

## Guild Loyalty

**Errata:**
- This card's ability should read '...you do not **discard** Guild cards.'

## Foiling Conspiracies

**Errata:**
- The Conspirator cannot guess their own Conspiracies. Instead of 'When you **secure**...' this card should read 'When a Rival of the Conspirator **secures**...'

## Magnate Act II Resolution

**Errata:**
- The reference to 'Fuel Interest' should read 'Shipping Interest'.

## Force Beams

**Errata:**
- The phrase 'in play areas' is added to this card in the second printing to improve some campaign game interactions.

## Steward Act II Resolution

**Errata:**
- The $link:Lesser Regent$ card references should say '20-21'.

## Steward Act III Setup

**Errata:**
- The $link:Govern the Imperial Reach$ card references should say '03-05'.

## Partisan Act II Setup

**Errata:**
- The $link:Partisan Seizing$ card reference should say '03'.

## Pacifist Act III Setup

**Errata:**
- The card references should read '09' through '12' in the order listed.

## Gate Wraith Act III Setup

**Errata:**
- 'Explain it and to everyone' should read 'Explain it to everyone.'

## Founder Act I Resolution

**Errata:**
- The card reference for 'Founder's next Resolution card' should be '23.'

## Spreading the Faith

**Errata:**
- The Teach action should have the attach and scrap sentences swapped. You cannot scrap unless you attach.

## Seats & Fiefs

**Errata:**
- This card should say 'if a city with a Seat is removed' rather than 'if a city with a Seat is destroyed' to cover cases where the city is removed from the map in other ways.

## Believer Act III Setup

**Errata:**
- This setup should remind you to place the Ideal markers in the same ambitions as they were in at the end of the previous Act.

## Agitator

**Errata:**
- The Agitator's *Irregular* ability should say 'is intercepted' rather than 'rolls `symbol:intercept`' so it interacts properly with cards such as $link:Mirror Plating$.

## Armistice

**Errata:**
- For clarity, this card should say 'from the attached card' rather than 'from here'.

## Feudal Courts

**Errata:**
- To clarify the intended effect, we have added 'If a Vassal **secures** a card with a Court token, the Court token remains on the refilled card.'.
- Add the following text 'If a Seat is returned, return its Court token.'

## Breaking Worlds

**Errata:**
- To clarify various interactions, we have rewritten step 3 of this card to the following: 'Destroy all buildings on the planet, placing them here, not in Trophies. Nobody Ransacks the Court.' and swapped it with step 2.

## Ire of the Keepers

**Errata:**
- The second sentence should read 'You cannot **tax** cities on Relic planets that you do not control.'

## Ire of the Tycoons

**Errata:**

## Unstable Harvester

## Unstable Warrior

**Errata:**
- To improve game flow, add this sentence: 'Scrap this if the Warrior is not in play.'

## Unstable Seeker

**Errata:**
- To improve game flow, add this sentence: 'Scrap this if the Seeker is not in play.'

## Unstable Protector

**Errata:**
- To improve game flow, add this sentence: 'Scrap this if the Protector is not in play.'

## Witnesses

## Commonwealth Membership

**Errata:**
- The text 'harms a Free city' should read 'harms a Free building.'

## Feast Day

**Errata:**
- The first sentence should end with ', keeping its Seat.' to clarify that replacing the city does not remove it.

## Breaking Gates & Placing Passages

**Errata:**
- Change points 2 and 3 to the following: 2. Place all ships and tokens from the gate onto the Twisted Passage, the central map area. The ships end their Catapult move. // 3. Return the building you used to Catapult--the starport on the map, or your Flagship's Slipstream Drive Upgrade and its Armor--as well as all buildings on the gate. *(Don't take any of these as Trophies. This does not count as harm.)*
