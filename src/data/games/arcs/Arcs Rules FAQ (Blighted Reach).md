# Rules FAQ (Blighted Reach)

This FAQ answers rule questions related to the rulebook for the Arcs Blighted Reach Expansion. For FAQs and errata on specific cards, please refer to the Card FAQ documentation.

This FAQ is not exhaustive—it does not cover every rule, just those that may be overlooked or cause confusion. It does not cover the base game—see the Base Game Rules FAQ.

Page numbers in this FAQ refer to the Blighted Reach Expansion rulebook unless otherwise noted. This document is based on a community FAQ originally compiled prior to release by turmoilbyrd. We're indebted!

## Errata

**Page 2, Stop!:** Mentions of "deep wells" should say "lower wells."  
*The deep well is where the removable trays are stored, not the small cards, as described in Organizing the Box on page 30.*

**Page 12, Event Cards:** Change the fourth sentence to the following. "However, your Event card gives you no actions if another Event card was played earlier this round or if the Imperial Council was secured earlier this round (page 14)!"  
*Changed this to passive voice so that it doesn't matter who did what. If an Event card was played or the Imperial Council was secured, you don't get the actions.*

**Page 14, Imperial Council Decided:** Add the following text. "If it flips while tucked under a card, return it to the Court."  
*After some soul-searching, we have reversed the previous behavior of the Council. This means cards like **Council Intrigue** can flip the Council while it's tucked under a card in the card play area, returning it to the Court. This cancels the resolution of the Council at the end of the round!*

**Page 15, The Free States, Raiding:** Added sentence "This counts as stealing."  
*This clarifies interactions with cards like **Pirate Hoard**.*

**Page 21, Imperial Trust:** Add the following text to the second sentence. "Resources in the Imperial Trust are **frozen** (page 27) except for Imperial Actions."  
*The Distribute Arms action under Imperial Actions already states that you give the Weapon from the Imperial Trust, but this addition codifies the exception for clarity.*

**Page 25, Lore & Flagships:** This section has been renamed "Cards & Flagships" and now applies to all cards, rather than just lore.  
*The consequence here is that edicts like Policy of Escalation properly interact with Flagships.*

**Page 27, Protected Guild Cards:** This now reads "Some Guild cards in the campaign are **protected**, shown by an "X" icon in place of their raid cost. They cannot be removed from the holder's play area unless the holder Provokes Outrage of its suit or the card is referenced by name."  
*This now explicitly states that cards like Command Chaos can remove Imperial Officers, even though it's protected, because it states it by name.*

**Page 27, Frozen:** This now reads "Sometimes resources are **frozen**. The player holding frozen resources cannot remove them from the freezing piece except with **scrap** or as stated by the freezing piece or pieces that reference it. For example, Govern the Imperial Reach can let the First Regent give Weapons from the Imperial Trust."  
*This better describes the cases where frozen applies and does not. Most importantly, it explicitly names scrap as an exception, whereas before it was implied by its absence.*

## Clarifications

### Setup

When adding Lore cards to the Court deck, don't look at them before adding them to the Court deck facedown.

### Resource Slots

When a card says that it can "hold" resources, this is equivalent to it saying it "has resource slots" for those resources. This is mostly relevant for interactions with **Golems**, particularly the **Golem Hearth**.

### Frozen Resources

In the Summit, players cannot be forced to give a frozen resource.

Frozen resources **can** be scrapped.

### Chapter End Structure

The campaign adds a few steps to ending the chapter. Here is a detailed timing breakdown.

1. Scoring Ambitions  
   1. Resolve effects that happen **at the start of scoring.**  
   2. Score ambitions. (In Act 3, also score grand ambitions.)  
   3. Advance objectives that happen **at the end of a chapter**.  
   4. Resolve effects that happen **after scoring**. If more than one needs to be resolved, the player with the initiative decides their order (base rulebook, page 22).  
2. Clean Up & Flip Ambition Marker  
3. End Game or Advance Chapter  
   1. If any final objectives are at "0," the game ends. If more than one is at "0," break the tie in turn order.  
   2. If it was the last chapter, the game ends.  
   3. Resolve effects that happen at **end of game**.  
   4. Advance the chapter marker.  
4. Draw Cards. Each player draws 6 cards for the next chapter.

### Protected Guild Cards

A protected Guild card cannot be removed from the holder's play area unless the holder Provokes Outrage in the corresponding suit, or unless a card mentions the protected Guild card by name. This means they cannot be given in Summit (e.g., **Guild Negotiations**, **Advocate's Demand**) or discarded (e.g., **Diplomatic Fiasco**, **Call to Pilgrimage**).

### Attaching Cards

You can attach a card to the Imperial Council regardless of which side it is on.

When the Imperial Council is secured, it is not refilled. This means not drawing a card to refill it. It also means that if it has an attached card that stays, the card does not slide down to refill (page 27).

### Flagships

While placing the Flagship, if you do not have any Loyal pieces on the map, you place 3 ships in a gate during step D of the Intermission (core rulebook, page 28).

The Flagship cannot be the target of Cede Control in the Summit.

You build Upgrades and Armor damaged if your Flagship's system is controlled by someone other than you.
